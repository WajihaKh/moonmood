# MoonMood

**Author**: Wajiha Khan

**Version**: 1.0.0

**Overview**:

In phase one, I had to:

1. Set up an account with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/start-developing/) and download the app through the QR code provided on their website.
2. Create an application with Expo using `npx create-expo-app@latest`.
3. Start the Expo development server with `npx expo start`.
4. Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal using the Expo app on my phone to link it to my laptop.

Phase one involved testing proof of life with no major changes and brainstorming mini project ideas.
